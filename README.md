# Hisako

Hisako is a simple web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It provides a fast development environment and an easy way to build modern web pages.

## What you need

You will need a recent version of Node.js and npm on your computer. You can download Node.js from https://nodejs.org. Installing Node.js also installs npm, which is used to manage project files.

To verify that Node.js and npm are correctly installed, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If these commands return version numbers, you're all set. If you see an error or no version information, download and install Node.js (which includes npm) from:

- Node.js official download page: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## How to get started

First, open a terminal or command prompt on your computer. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the project files to your machine by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0oTMNo0/hisako.git
   cd hisako
   ```
2. Install everything the project needs:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the app in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5173 to see the site.

Any changes you make to the files will automatically update in the browser.

## How to prepare for production

When you are ready to share your site with others, build an optimized version by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This places the finished files in a new folder called `dist`. You can upload those files to any web hosting service.
